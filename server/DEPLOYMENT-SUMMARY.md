# 🎉 Nginx Photo Server - Deployment Complete!

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. Nginx Server Configuration
- ✅ Installed nginx 1.24.0
- ✅ Configured on port 8081 (coexists with Apache on port 80)
- ✅ Created pikapp-photos system user
- ✅ Set up photo directory: `/var/www/pikapp-photos/`
- ✅ Configured CORS headers for Firebase integration
- ✅ Enabled gzip compression and browser caching (1 year)
- ✅ Added security headers

### 2. Cloudflare Tunnel Setup
- ✅ Updated existing tunnel: `ct-42210-server`
- ✅ Added route: `pikapp-photos.ct-42210.com` → `localhost:8081`
- ✅ Created DNS CNAME record via `cloudflared tunnel route dns`
- ✅ Tunnel config backed up in git repo
- ✅ Service restarted and validated

### 3. Upload Script Updates
- ✅ Added `deploy_to_nginx()` function
- ✅ Configured to use root SSH user (existing njt-hpe-proliant key)
- ✅ Added `--chown=pikapp-photos:pikapp-photos` to prevent permission issues
- ✅ Added `--chmod=D755,F644` for proper file permissions
- ✅ Upload workflow: Process → Upload to nginx → Commit to git → Deploy to Firebase

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ Updated `outline.txt` with complete server specifications
- ✅ Created `/server/README.md` with setup instructions
- ✅ Created `/server/SETUP-COMPLETE.md` with deployment status
- ✅ Added Cloudflare Tunnel configuration to git repo
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude photo directories

### 5. Testing
- ✅ Local nginx access: Working (port 8081)
- ✅ CORS headers: Verified
- ✅ Cloudflare Tunnel: Working
- ✅ Public URL: https://pikapp-photos.ct-42210.com (accessible)
- ✅ Caching: 1 year cache-control headers present
- ✅ Permissions: Files owned by pikapp-photos user

## 🔧 How It Works

### Photo Upload Workflow

1. **Local Development:**
   - Original photos placed in `/public/albums/[album-name]/`
   - Run `./upload.sh` to process photos
   - Script creates webP thumbnails in `/low/` folder
   - Script copies originals to `/full/` folder

2. **Upload to Nginx Server:**
   - Rsync uploads photos via SSH as root user
   - Photos automatically chowned to pikapp-photos:pikapp-photos
   - Permissions set to 755 (dirs) and 644 (files)
   - Files uploaded to `/var/www/pikapp-photos/[album-name]/`

3. **Commit to Git:**
   - Metadata files (albums.json, data.json) committed
   - Photo files excluded via .gitignore

4. **Deploy to Firebase:**
   - Website code and metadata deployed
   - No photos uploaded (served from nginx instead)

### Request Flow

```
User Browser
    ↓
Firebase Hosting (pikapp-photos.web.app)
    → Serves HTML/CSS/JS
    → Serves albums.json and data.json
    ↓
Loads photos via JavaScript:
    ↓
https://pikapp-photos.ct-42210.com/[album]/low/[photo].webp
    ↓
Cloudflare Tunnel
    ↓
localhost:8081 (nginx)
    ↓
/var/www/pikapp-photos/[album]/low/[photo].webp
    ↓
Photo served with CORS headers + 1yr cache
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Local Development:

1. **Add photos to an album:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p public/albums/my-first-album
   # Add JPG/PNG photos to this directory
   ```

2. **Process and upload:**
   ```bash
   ./upload.sh
   # Answer prompts for album name and photographer
   # Confirm nginx upload: y
   # Confirm git push: y
   # Confirm Firebase deploy: y
   ```

3. **Access photos:**
   - Locally: http://localhost:8081/my-first-album/low/my_first_album_1.webp
   - Public: https://pikapp-photos.ct-42210.com/my-first-album/low/my_first_album_1.webp

### Maintenance Commands:

```bash
# View nginx logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/pikapp-photos-access.log

# Restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# Update nginx config from git
cd /root/pikapp-photos/server/nginx
sudo bash deploy.sh

# Check Cloudflare Tunnel status
sudo systemctl status cloudflared

# Verify permissions on photos
ls -la /var/www/pikapp-photos/
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ Nginx runs as non-root user (pikapp-photos)
- ✅ Server tokens disabled (hides nginx version)
- ✅ Directory indexing disabled
- ✅ Hidden files denied
- ✅ CORS restricted to pikapp-photos.web.app only
- ✅ Cloudflare tunnel provides SSL/HTTPS automatically
- ✅ No direct server ports exposed (all via tunnel)

## 📊 Performance Features

- ✅ Gzip compression enabled
- ✅ Browser caching: 1 year (immutable content)
- ✅ WebP format reduces file sizes by ~30%
- ✅ Thumbnails at 50% size for fast loading
- ✅ Cloudflare CDN caching worldwide

## 📝 Configuration Files

All server configuration is version-controlled in the git repository:

- **System Location:** `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, `/etc/nginx/sites-available/pikapp-photos.conf`
- **Git Repo:** `/root/pikapp-photos/server/nginx/`
- **Cloudflare System:** `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml`
- **Cloudflare Git:** `/root/pikapp-photos/server/cloudflared-config.yml`

Changes to configs should be made in the git repo, then deployed using:
```bash
cd /root/pikapp-photos/server/nginx
sudo bash deploy.sh
```
